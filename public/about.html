<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey, my name is Biru Basfore. I am a front-end developer living in Assam, India. I have just started learning web development in 2024 with an online course of Udemy. This platform is awesome for learnig most of the high in-demand skills. With my creativity and design skills, I will help small businesses and brands to create and level up their websites. This thinking boosts me to work upon my goals and objectives. The Front-end development includes learning HTML, CSS, Javascript, libraries, frameworks and version control, etc. My journey is long and but I enjoy it a lot. I am also doing my Bachelor's in BBA from Shoolini University, India this year along with coding. In future, I will also do back-end developemnt, which will help me much more to make my own websites and present it to the world. That's all about me. Thank you so much! </p>
